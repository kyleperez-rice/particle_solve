This is a program designed to solve an n-body simulation:
A group of particles subject to internal forces and external forces, and how the system
evolves in time.

Alongside the various C++ files that compose the particle_solve program, there is a 
Python file: 'plotter.py' which produces an animation of the particles at hand,
if given the correct number of particles in the simulation.


Running the program:
(if your compiler is g++):
	Enter the folder that contains all the files
	Run 'make' in the directory
	run './particle_solve'
	run 'python plotter.py'
	
	This should produce a running animation of the code.
	
If your compiler is not g++, change the makefile to include your compiler.
If you want a different executable name, change the settings in the makefile.
